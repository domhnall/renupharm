          We use reCAPTCHA when we capture data from visitors who are not logged in.
          Forms or surveys on a website can be easily completed by automated scripts or robots, which can severely inhibit the usefulness of these tools.
          reCAPTCHA offers a solution to ensure that the form or survey submission has been completed by a real human being.
          The cookie stored on the browser by reCAPTCHA helps to make the determination about whether or not you are a robot.
