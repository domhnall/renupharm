# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

    heading: RenuPharm Survey
    intro: RenuPharm is an Irish-owned business aiming to provide an alternative source for pharmaceuticals across Ireland.  Pharmacies registered on the RenuPharm platform will have the option of purchasing medicinal products from other Irish pharmacies who have a temporary over-stock and/or no usage of the same product.
    benefits:
      intro: "The RenuPharm platform offers mutual benefits to the buying and selling pharmacies:"
      buyer: The selling pharmacy can offload stock that may otherwise require disposal, reducing product wastage, man-hours and disposal costs.
      seller: The buying pharmacy benefits from an alternative channel for sourcing stock and the potential of picking this up at a significant discount from typical wholesale price.
