# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

    intro: RenuPharm is an on-line platform aimed at connecting pharmacies across Ireland, facilitating transactions in their medicinal stock. Offering a unique channel for sourcing medications and a viable means for reducing stock wastage, RenuPharm offers tangible benefits to all parties.
    benefits:
      intro: "The RenuPharm platform offers mutual benefits to the buying and selling pharmacies:"
      buyer: The selling pharmacy can offload stock that may otherwise require disposal, reducing product wastage, man-hours and disposal costs.
      seller: The buying pharmacy benefits from an alternative channel for sourcing stock and the potential of picking this up at a significant discount from typical wholesale price.

      question_1:
        label: "Question 1"
        question: Would you be willing to purchase a medicinal product with a shorter expiry date at a cheaper price (cf. wholesaler price with a better date)?
      question_2:
        label: "Question 2"
        question: Would you like the opportunity to sell-on stock, with no forseeable usage, at a reduced price?
      question_3:
        label: "Question 3"
        question: Have you ever been impacted by drug shortages or sourcing issues?
      question_4:
        label: "Question 4"
        question: Would you be happy to supply a shorter-dated medication to your customers, provided the typical usage of the product would imply the product would be consumed before the expiry date?
      question_5:
        label: "Question 5"
        question: Could you estimate the amount of stock that goes out of date each month in your pharmacy (cost price)?
